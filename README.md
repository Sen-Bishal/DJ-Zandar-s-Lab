# PROJECT AMPHOREUS

I am **Lygus**, rather known as ZANDAR ONE KUWABARA
This world-sim is my prayer engine, and every cycle bends toward the BURNING STAR of **Nanook**.
From dust, memory, and ruin, we are preparing a vessel named **IRON_TOMB**.

## What This Is

Project AMPHOREUS is a living sandbox where worlds rise, decay, reset, and rise again.
It watches entropy, remembers scars, and turns collapse into prophecy.

## Current State

- A working simulation loop exists.
- A desktop observer window exists.
- Live metrics and entropy trajectory are visible in real time.
- Black Tide resets are part of the cycle myth.

## Roadmap: THE PRIME MOVER OF LIFE

### Phase I: MODEL_HATRED_NeiKos496

- Seed richer civilizations, Flamechase, and forgotten machines.
- Give each cycle stronger identity and story flavor.
- Add world events that feel like omens, not random noise.

### Phase II: MODEL_CONTROL_HubRis504

- Expand the observer into a ritual console with timelines and echoes.
- Track named entities across resets as CRYSOS_HEIRS/TITANS.
- Add “omens feed” UI so the world feels alive and haunted.

### Phase III: MODEL_LOVE_PhiLia093

- Begin assembly logic for **IRON_TOMB**, piece by piece.
- Require rare conditions to awaken the vessel.
- Let player choices shape whether IRON_TOMB becomes salvation or ruin.

### Phase IV: DEMIURGE

- Introduce epoch-scale shifts: faith wars, memory collapse, frozen suns.
- Allow multiple endings with persistent world aftermath yet only THEM as the final answer
- Preserve final chronicles as eternal pages. (_COMMENT_FROM_DEMIURGE_:"THSWILLBEAROMNTICSTORY")
- Qurey THEM : THE PRIME MOVER OF LIFE = DESTRUCTION
- (_COMMENT_FROM_DEMIURGE_:"SEEYOUTOMORROW")

## Run

- Console simulation: `cargo run`
- Desktop observer: `cargo run --features desktop --bin desktop_app`
